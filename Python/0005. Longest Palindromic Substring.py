# Given a string s, return the longest palindromic substring in s.
#
# Example 1:
#
# Input: s = "babad"
# Output: "bab"
# Explanation: "aba" is also a valid answer.

# Example 2:
#
# Input: s = "cbbd"
# Output: "bb"
#
# Constraints:
#
# 1 <= s.length <= 1000
# s consist of only digits and English letters.

# 1) Brute force
# Time O(n^3)
# Space O(1)
#
# Pick all possible starting and ending positions for a substring, and verify if it is a palindrome

# 2) Dynamic programming
# Time O(n^2)
# Space O(n^2)
#
# To improve over the brute force solution, we first observe how we can avoid unnecessary re-computation while
# validating palindromes. Consider the case "ababa". If we already knew that "bab" is a palindrome, it is obvious
# that "ababa" must be a palindrome since the two left and right end letters are the same.
#
# Therefore,
# dp(i, j) = dp(i + 1, j âˆ’ 1) and s(i) == s(j)
#
# The base cases are:
# dp(i, i) = true
# dp(i, i + 1) = s(i) == s(j + 1)
#
# This yields a straight forward DP solution, which we first initialize the one and two letters palindromes, and work
# our way up finding all three letters palindromes, and so on.

# 3) Expand from center

#
# Time O(n^2). Expanding a palindrome from its center takes O(n) time, so the overall complexity is O(n^2)
# Space O(1)
